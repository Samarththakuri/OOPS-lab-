/*4) In an Online Shopping System, different methods for handling product inventory and discounts need to be securely managed. Create a package ECommerce containing a class Product with a public method getProductDetails() to retrieve product information, a protected method applyDiscount() for internal discount management, a default-access method updateStock() for inventory updates within the same package, and a private method calculateProfit() that computes earnings internally. Then, create another package CustomerPortal with a class CustomerCart that attempts to access these methods from an instance of Product. Demonstrate which methods are accessible and explain how Javaâ€™s access control mechanism ensures that only the appropriate users can access sensitive product operations.
